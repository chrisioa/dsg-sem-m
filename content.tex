This section is about work that is related to the topic of my seminar thesis, you know?

\section{Enabling Technologies}
Extending Networking into the Virtualization Layer (see \cite{pfaff2009extending}) summarizes how the traditionally monolithic and physically bound domain of networking can be broken up and modularized by means of virtualization. The following three parts would focus on enabling and supporting technologies needed to realize the vision of this new paradigm. First, the business logic needs to be packaged and executed. This can happen in virtual machines, containers etc. Following that, virtualized switching technology needs to be put in place to allow for successful packet forwarding. One technology is Open vSwitch which is an implementation of a virtual switch, connecting virtual interfaces of VMs for instance with physical interfaces. Docker and Kubernetes additionally provide means for communication between several, executable artifacts.
\todo{You quickly move to a tool/implementation. Can you stay on the conceptual level more before you dive into possible solutions? Maybe explain that using a diagram would help?}

\section{Network Functions}
Before venturing into Virtualized Network Functions, it needs to be clarified what network functions are in general, how they are implemented and composed \textit{physically}, and what the motivations are to move towards virtualizing them. 
\subsection{Physical Network Service Composition}
The inner makings of a cloud: A lot of custom hardware (middleboxes) for services like intrusion detection, firewalls and the optimization of the Wide Area Network (WAN) have often been used (and still used to this day), in extremely high numbers. This leads to several impairments with growing networks: High investment costs, high operational costs, no or limited upgradeability and automatization   \cite{sherry2016middleboxes}. This part shall provide motivation to use aforementioned technologies to provide a more flexible and automatable solution. This will only gain importance with higher complexity and higher demand of the networks that are being built (Growing cloud data centers, implementation of 5G, etc). 

\subsection{Network Virtualization}
\subsubsection{Software Defined Networking}
\begin{description}
	\item [SDN] SDN: Breakup of the control and data plane, routing hardware (switches) can be organized and ()re-)configured from a distributed controller software without the need of cumbersome manual efforts.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Virtualized Network Functions in Network Function Virtualization ( VNFs vs NFVs )}
NFV and VNF basics \cite{mijumbi2016network} NFV real-world impact \cite{bilal2016impact} Service orchestration \cite{de2018network}

\begin{description}
	\item [VNF] Can complement the SDN paradigm (but can exist independently)  by providing functionality needed in the network domain as an executable artifact
	\item [NFV] NFV integrates VNFs into a system that can manage and deploy these functions in sensible manner. 
\end{description}
\todo{References for the definitions}
\subsubsection{Organizations and Motivations}
ETSI proposing NFV architecture already in 2012 in a white paper  \cite{nfv_wp}. The CNCF (Cloud-native Computing Foundation) has launched a testbed to compare the performance of VNFs on an OpenStack enviromnent versus a Kubernetes setup \footnote{https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2019/02/25/cncf-launches-cloud-native-network-functions-cnf-testbed/}	

\section{Cloud-native NFV}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Interoperability of VNFs}
A lot of proprietary and custom build environments which VNFs are build for and deployed onto. This limits their effectiveness considerably.
\subsection{Design Principles for Cloud-native VNFs }
What is cloud-native, how do these principles relate to  the networking domain? Whitepapers published by Analysys Mason \cite{evolutionnfv} and Cisco \cite{CNF}
\subsection{Managing VNFs efficiently (CI/CD and Management)}
Virtual Machines, Openstack vs Docker and Kubernetes managing and orchestrating the deployment of network functionality, what are the benefits? What are drawbacks?
\subsection{Cloud-native network functions}
Definition, advantages, state-of-the-art, testbed 
\todo{I am missing somewhat talking about the problems. What are the challenges that NF solve in general? What changes in the cloud native / K8s world? What does that mean for the challenges that traditional NF solve? I have the feeling, you jump too quickly to the solutions and showing advantages and disadvantages (which is great), but forget to define the problems and challenges clearly before. }

\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
Combining several concepts like for instance an SDN-controller deploying and managing VNFs/CNFs  on demand could create even more efficient and interesting possibilities where specific functions and services could deploy dynamically when they are being requested. Lifecycle management can be done by the SDN-Controller. 
\todo{Future Work typically means what YOU would do if you had infinite time for your research. Not what the technology will be in the future. Try to use a different name for that section. Or did I read that wrongly?}
