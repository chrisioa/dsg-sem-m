\begin{abstract}
Implementing Network Functions has long been realized with proprietary, and highly integrated, purpose-built physical boxes. With the growing capabilities of fourth and especially fifth generation networks, newer and more flexible solutions are needed to guarantee innovative, end-to-end services. A first step towards this goal are Virtualized Network Functions, heavily relying on virtual machines and an underlying infrastructure, abstracting from physical hardware. Often the functionalities have been ported from a middlebox to a VM. With the advancements in Cloud Computing, more flexible approaches to developing distributed software that put the focus on automation, scalability and reliability have been defined. Applying these principles to the network function domain, yields Cloud-native Network Functions (CNFs).
